#
# This file lists the Python packages required to run the dendrochronology
# scripts (`gogo.py` and `date-x.py`).
#
# To install these requirements, it's highly recommended to use a virtual environment:
#
# 1. Create a virtual environment (if you don't have one):
#    python -m venv venv_name
#
# 2. Activate the virtual environment:
#    - On Windows: .\venv_name\Scripts\activate
#    - On macOS/Linux: source venv_name/bin/activate
#
# 3. Install the packages:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Versioning:
# Using 'package>=X.Y.Z' means "install version X.Y.Z or newer".
# These are common stable versions known to work well with the features used in the scripts.
# If you encounter issues, you can try specific versions found from 'pip freeze' on a working setup.
